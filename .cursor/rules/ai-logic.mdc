# AI Logic and Integration

## Core AI Services
- The main AI service logic is in [includes/Chatbot/Services/ChatbotService.php](mdc:dokan-chatbot/includes/Chatbot/Services/ChatbotService.php).
- Context for AI conversations is built in [includes/Chatbot/Services/ContextBuilder.php](mdc:dokan-chatbot/includes/Chatbot/Services/ContextBuilder.php).
- Role and prompt management utilities are in [includes/Chatbot/Services/RoleManager.php](mdc:dokan-chatbot/includes/Chatbot/Services/RoleManager.php) and [includes/Chatbot/Utils/PromptTemplates.php](mdc:dokan-chatbot/includes/Chatbot/Utils/PromptTemplates.php).

## REST API
- The chatbot REST API endpoints are defined in [includes/Chatbot/REST/ChatbotController.php](mdc:dokan-chatbot/includes/Chatbot/REST/ChatbotController.php).
- These endpoints handle chat requests, context retrieval, and message history.

## Chat History
- Chat history is managed in [includes/Chatbot/Utils/ChatHistory.php](mdc:dokan-chatbot/includes/Chatbot/Utils/ChatHistory.php).

## Frontend Integration
- The React frontend communicates with the REST API for chat operations, using components in [src/chatbot/components/](mdc:dokan-chatbot/src/chatbot/components).

Use this rule to quickly locate and understand the AI-related logic and integration points in the plugin.
